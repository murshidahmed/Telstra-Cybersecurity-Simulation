Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation

This repository documents my learning and tasks completed during the Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation.
Through this program, I gained hands-on exposure to real-world cybersecurity scenarios by stepping into the role of a Telstra cybersecurity team member.

The simulation focused on understanding, communicating, mitigating, and reflecting on a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. It helped me strengthen my incident response thinking, technical analysis skills, and professional communication—while giving practical insight into how cybersecurity teams operate in a global technology organization.

This experience contributed to my practical cybersecurity knowledge and supports my career development in defensive security roles.
